"""Enhanced Candidate Evaluation System - Intelligent Job-Candidate Matching

This script implements the complete workflow you described:
1. Planner Agent orchestrates everything
2. Resume Parser Agent extracts info (including GitHub links)
3. GitHub Agent does initial scan
4. Planner Agent matches against job description
5. Planner Agent identifies relevant repositories
6. GitHub Agent does deep code analysis of specific repos
7. Planner Agent analyzes code quality and provides final assessment
