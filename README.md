## What is HireBuddy?

HireBuddy takes a resume and a job description to quickly analyze a candidate's experience, projects, and GitHub profile, including repositories, activity, and languages. It then produces a transparent score with a clear breakdown of the factors. If a human reviewer approves the analysis, the system automatically prepares the interview email and scheduling details in one seamless flow.

**Problem**
Early screening today is slow and inconsistent:
- Re-reading similar resumes
- Skipping or shallow GitHub checks
- Little written reasoning
- Manual email + scheduling steps

Hiring teams need fast, consistent, explainable evaluation without adding another bloated platform.

**Solution**
Multiâ€‘agent flow (Resume, GitHub, Matching, Scheduler) powered by Portia AI:
- Builds a structured candidate profile
- Analyzes repos, activity, languages
- Produces a weighted score with plain reasons
- Streams each step so you see progress
- Can draft emails and prep an interview slot

**How It Solves It**
Everything runs as one simple flow: ingest â†’ enrich â†’ score â†’ decide â†’ (optional) schedule. Standard scoring plus saved reasoning reduces bias and keeps a record while leaving the final call to the recruiter.

Short video explaining agent orchestration, data flow, and scoring pipeline.

HireBuddy uses a multi-agent architecture where specialized AI agents collaborate:

- **Resume Agent** - Extracts structured data from any resume format using LLM parsing
- **GitHub Agent** - Performs deep analysis of coding profiles, repositories, and contribution patterns  
- **Supervisor Agent** - Orchestrates the workflow and makes intelligent routing decisions
- **Scheduler Agent** - Handles interview scheduling with Google Calendar and email automation

Each agent specializes in their domain while the supervisor coordinates the entire evaluation process.

## Core Features

### Intelligent Resume Analysis
- PDF / DOCX / text parsing
- Structured skills, experience, education
- Normalized skill grouping

### Advanced GitHub Analysis  
- Repo relevance + activity
- Language / stack map
- Contribution & quality hints

### Smart Matching
- Weighted scoring (skills, experience, GitHub, education)
- Clear reasoning lines

### Automated Workflow
- Live step stream
- Optional email + scheduling
- Decision log (CSV/JSON)

## Why We Use Portia AI
Portia AI is the backbone. All agents (planner, resume, GitHub, scheduler) run on it. It orders steps, shares data, calls tools, streams status, and retries on soft failures (like rate limits). Less glue code, easier to add new agents (coding test, ATS export). Tools used: resume_parser, github_scanner, job_matcher, assessment_generator, candidate_tracker, repository/code analyzers, scheduler (calendar + email). Shared context removes manual handâ€‘offs and keeps an audit trail.

## How It Works
1. Upload resume + job description
2. Parse resume â†’ structured profile
3. Scan GitHub â†’ repos, activity, languages
4. Score + show reasons
5. (Optional) Generate email + scheduling data
6. Save decision

## Technical Implementation

### Resume Processing Pipeline
HireBuddy uses a multi-layered approach for resume parsing:
1. **Format Detection** - Automatically identifies PDF, DOCX, or text formats
2. **Text Extraction** - Uses multiple libraries (PyPDF2, pdfplumber, PyMuPDF) for robust extraction
3. **LLM Analysis** - Gemini/GPT models parse unstructured text into structured data
4. **Data Validation** - Pydantic models ensure data quality and consistency

### GitHub Analysis Engine
The GitHub analysis combines API data with intelligent processing:
1. **Profile Scanning** - Retrieves comprehensive profile and repository data
2. **Repository Filtering** - Identifies relevant repositories based on job requirements
3. **Code Quality Assessment** - Analyzes documentation, structure, and best practices
4. **Activity Pattern Recognition** - Evaluates contribution consistency and collaboration

### Intelligent Matching Algorithm
The matching system uses weighted scoring across multiple dimensions:
- **Skill Alignment** - Fuzzy matching between candidate skills and job requirements
- **Experience Relevance** - Contextual analysis of work experience descriptions
- **GitHub Quality Score** - Repository quality, activity level, and code patterns
- **Cultural Fit Indicators** - Communication style, project types, and collaboration patterns
