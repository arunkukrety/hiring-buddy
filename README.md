## What is HireBuddy?

HireBuddy is a lean AI agent system that turns an uploaded resume + job description into a scored, evidenceâ€‘backed hiring decision (and optional scheduled interview) in minutes.

**Problem**
Earlyâ€‘stage screening is slow, subjective, and fragmented:
- Manual resume parsing is repetitive
- GitHub review (if done) is shallow or skipped
- Match rationale is rarely documented
- Scheduling and email followâ€‘ups burn time

**Crux**
Hiring teams need fast, consistent, explainable evaluation without adding another bloated platform.

**Solution**
Multiâ€‘agent workflow (Resume, GitHub, Matching, Scheduler) powered by Portia AI:
- Extracts structured candidate profile
- Performs deep GitHub repo + activity relevance analysis
- Generates transparent weighted match score with reasons
- Streams every step for trust (no hidden black box)
- Optionally drafts emails & books the interview

**How It Solves It**
Automation compresses hours of fragmented manual work into a single deterministic flow: ingest â†’ enrich â†’ score â†’ decide â†’ communicate. Standardized scoring + captured rationale reduce bias and create an auditable trail while preserving recruiter judgment at the decision gate.

Short video explaining agent orchestration, data flow, and scoring pipeline.

HireBuddy uses a multi-agent architecture where specialized AI agents collaborate:

- **Resume Agent** - Extracts structured data from any resume format using LLM parsing
- **GitHub Agent** - Performs deep analysis of coding profiles, repositories, and contribution patterns  
- **Supervisor Agent** - Orchestrates the workflow and makes intelligent routing decisions
- **Scheduler Agent** - Handles interview scheduling with Google Calendar and email automation

Each agent specializes in their domain while the supervisor coordinates the entire evaluation process.

## Portia AI Core (How We Use It)

Portia AI is the backbone of this project. Every agent you see (planner/supervisor, resume, GitHub, scheduler) is a Portia agent. Portia handles:
- Orchestrating the exact order of steps (no adâ€‘hoc scripts)
- Passing structured outputs from one agent/tool to the next (shared context)
- Managing tool calls (so code just declares intent, not plumbing)
- Streaming intermediate status so the UI shows real progress
- Containing failures (a later step can still run if an earlier nonâ€‘critical tool partially fails)

### Where Portia AI Is Used in the Flow
1. Upload â†’ planner stores raw files in context
2. Resume parsing tool -> structured candidate profile added to context
3. GitHub scan tool -> repos, languages, activity added
4. Matching + assessment tools -> scores + reasoning objects
5. Decision + email/scheduling -> scheduler tool prepares calendar + message artifacts
6. Tracking tool appends final decision for audit

### Portia Agent Roles (Plain Words)
- Planner: decides next step, merges results, builds the final narrative
- Resume Agent: extracts clean structured data (skills, experience, education)
- GitHub Agent: pulls profile + repos + contribution signals, filters relevance
- Scheduler Agent: prepares interview invite artifacts (email text, calendar details)

### Tools We Call Through Portia
- resume_parser: multiâ€‘library text extraction + normalization
- github_scanner: GraphQL + heuristic repo relevance & activity metrics
- job_matcher: compares candidate skill/profile vectors to job requirements
- assessment_generator: composes weighted scoring + reasoning breakdown
- candidate_tracker: persists decision row (CSV/JSON)
- code / repository analyzers (where enabled): language spread, complexity hints
- calendar/email integration (via scheduler) for final scheduling output

### Why Portia Fits Here
Simple: we needed a clean multiâ€‘agent pipeline without writing custom orchestration glue. Portia gives shared state, consistent tool wiring, retry hooks, and streaming out of the boxâ€”so we focus on the actual evaluation logic instead of framework code.

## How It Works

### 1. File Upload
Users upload candidate resumes and job descriptions through the web interface. The system supports multiple formats and provides real-time validation.

### 2. Resume Analysis
The Resume Agent uses LLM models to extract structured data:
- Personal information and contact details
- Work experience with role descriptions and durations
- Educational background and certifications
- Skills categorized by type and proficiency
- Projects with technology stacks and descriptions

### 3. GitHub Profile Analysis
If a GitHub profile is found, the GitHub Agent performs:
- Repository scanning with relevance scoring
- Code quality assessment based on documentation, structure, and community engagement
- Contribution pattern analysis for consistency and activity levels
- Technology stack identification and mapping to job requirements
- Project complexity evaluation

### 4. Job Matching & Scoring
The system performs intelligent matching:
- **Required Skills Match** (40% weight) - How well candidate skills align with must-have requirements
- **Experience Alignment** (25% weight) - Relevance of work experience to the role
- **GitHub Activity** (20% weight) - Quality and consistency of coding contributions
- **Education Background** (15% weight) - Educational qualifications and certifications

### 5. Decision & Scheduling
Based on the analysis, recruiters can:
- Review detailed candidate insights and match scores
- Make informed hiring decisions with AI recommendations
- Automatically generate personalized interview invitations
- Schedule interviews with Google Calendar integration
- Track all decisions for analytics and improvement

## Technical Implementation

### Resume Processing Pipeline
HireBuddy uses a multi-layered approach for resume parsing:
1. **Format Detection** - Automatically identifies PDF, DOCX, or text formats
2. **Text Extraction** - Uses multiple libraries (PyPDF2, pdfplumber, PyMuPDF) for robust extraction
3. **LLM Analysis** - Gemini/GPT models parse unstructured text into structured data
4. **Data Validation** - Pydantic models ensure data quality and consistency

### GitHub Analysis Engine
The GitHub analysis combines API data with intelligent processing:
1. **Profile Scanning** - Retrieves comprehensive profile and repository data
2. **Repository Filtering** - Identifies relevant repositories based on job requirements
3. **Code Quality Assessment** - Analyzes documentation, structure, and best practices
4. **Activity Pattern Recognition** - Evaluates contribution consistency and collaboration

### Intelligent Matching Algorithm
The matching system uses weighted scoring across multiple dimensions:
- **Skill Alignment** - Fuzzy matching between candidate skills and job requirements
- **Experience Relevance** - Contextual analysis of work experience descriptions
- **GitHub Quality Score** - Repository quality, activity level, and code patterns
- **Cultural Fit Indicators** - Communication style, project types, and collaboration patterns
